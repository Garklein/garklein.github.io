Advent of Code 2025 in Prolog
=============================

It's [that time of year again](https://adventofcode.com/2025)!! This year, I'm learning [Prolog](https://www.scryer.pl/). I tried this a few years ago, and failed miserably; hopefully it will go better this year!

I have a lot of common stuff in my [.scryerrc file](dotscryerrc).
