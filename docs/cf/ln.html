Estimating ln(x) in <span class=red>color</span><span class=green>Forth</span> (without floats)
===============================================

Motivation [skip to avoid a Project Euler spoiler]
--------------------------------------------------
You can solve <a href='https://projecteuler.net/problem=25'>Project Euler 25</a> in 2 ways. The most obvious way is to use bignums to generate Fibonacci numbers until you've found the first with over 1000 digits. But I wanted to get a little spicier.

It turns out, the answer to this problem is

          ln(5)/2 + 999 ln(10)
1 + floor --------------------
                 ln(φ)

The reasoning is left as an exercise to the reader ;)

Now, we're faced with an issue: how do we compute ln(x) in <span class=red>color</span><span class=green>Forth</span>.


Fixed point arithmetic
----------------------
For that matter, how can we represent decimal numbers at all? There are no floats in <span class=red>color</span><span class=green>Forth</span>; all we have to work with are 32-bit ints.

For a bit of background, Forths traditionally have no floating point. Instead, they use *Fixed Point*.

In fixed point arithmetic, we treat each number as if it has an implicit denominator. For example, we might say that <span class=green>1</span> represents 1/100, <span class=green>2</span> represents 2/100, <span class=green>500</span> represents 500/100 = 5, etc.

With this representation, we get addition and subtraction for free - to add/subtract fractions with like denominators, you just add/subtract the numerators. Multiplication and division require a bit more thought.

Suppose we have two fixed point numbers, x and y, and we want to compute their product. x represents x/100 and y represents y/100, so the actual value of their product is xy/10000. To get this actual value back into our fixed point representation, we want it to have a denominator of 100.

 x * y      x*y/100
-------  =  -------,
100*100       100

so the fixed point representation of the product is xy/100.

Now, the especially clear-seeing ones among you might spot an issue. For sufficiantly large x and y, computing their product will overflow. To resolve this, <span class=red>color</span><span class=green>Forth</span> provides a special word: <span class=green>*/</span>.

<span class=green>x y z */</span> computes xy/z (I like to read it as multiplying by a fraction: x * y/z), but uses a 64-bit intermediate result for the product. This greatly reduces the chance of overflow.

With 100 as our fixed point denominator, multiplication is <span class=green>x y 100 */</span>. Similarly, division is <span class=green>x 100 y */</span>.

Let's put this into practice with some <span class=red>color</span><span class=green>Forth</span> code. I'll be using an arbitrary power of two, say 2^19. We can get a bit cheeky here when defining our denominator. Our denominator is our way to represent 1, so we can call the word <span class=green>1</span>.

<span class=red>1</span> <span class=white>-n</span> <i class=hgreen>80000</i> <span class=green>;</span>

When defining a number as a word, we need to use its text representation, which is typed with a backtick before the number. Visually, our <span class=green>1</span> is identical to the number <span class=green>1</span>, and it only differs in its internal representation and how we type it. Being unable to tell whether a stray <span class=green>1</span> is 1 or 2^19 is perhaps a bad idea, but we roll with it.

To convert <span class=green>x</span> to fixed point, we use <span class=green>x 1 *</span>. To multiply or divide <span class=green>x</span> and <span class=green>y</span>, we use <span class=green>x y 1 */</span> and <span class=green>x 1 y */</span> respectively. Here, the fraction view is helpful: multiplying is x * y/1 and dividing is x * 1/y - exactly like you'd expect!

Here are some helpers to convert a number to fixed point, and to do fixed point division.

<span class=red>*1</span> <span class=white>n-n</span> <span class=green>1 * ;</span>
<span class=red>*1/</span> <span class=white>nn-n</span> <span class=green>1 swap */ ;</span>


Logging time!
-------------
Now that we've got fractions, we can get to the ln part.

There *is* one "log" that is very easy to compute - floor(log2(x)). This is just the index of the highest set bit.

From here, it's clear that we can represent any number x as 2^k * m, where k is a natural number (the floor(log2(x)) from earlier) and m is in the real interval [1, 2).

ln(x)
= ln(2^k * m)
= ln(2^k) + ln(m)
= k ln(2) + ln(m)

Now, we just need to be able to compute ln(x) over the interval [1, 2], and we can do just that with a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6DsjIBzJ4'>Taylor series</a>!

Working out the Taylor series for ln(x) around x=a gives us

                 ∞                      n
                \--    n+1   -n  (x - a)
ln(x) = ln(a) +  &gt;  (-1)  * a  * -------
                /--                 n
               n = 1

Time to implement this in <span class=red>color</span><span class=green>Forth</span>!

I decided to use a main word, <span class=green>tayl</span>, to compute the sum. This word will take a and x from the stack.

This word will use a <span class=green>for</span> loop to calculate each term. We need some set up for this loop. There needs to be an accumulator somewhere, to hold the sum so far. Since stack manipulation gets messy, we want to minimize manipulation inside the loop. The variable a is never needed on its own, only x - a, so we can pre-compute that.

This word rearranges the stack to 0 (the accumulator), then x - a, then a.

<span class=red>0,x-a,a</span> <span class=white>ax-cya</span> <span class=green>0 -rot swap dup negate u+ ;</span>

Inside the loop, it will be useful to be able to get n from a nested word. Inside the for loop, the index will be on the return stack. When we call a word (that, say, computes one part of the term), this pushes onto the return stack. When this word calls <span class=green>n</span>, that will push again onto the return stack. So, <span class=green>n</span> needs to pick the 3rd element from the return stack.

<span class=red>n</span> <span class=white>-n</span> <span class=green>2pop i -rot 2push ;</span>

<span class=green>2pop</span> pops the two addresses off the return stack, <span class=green>i</span> copies the index, <span class=green>-rot</span> buries it under the two addresses, and <span class=green>2push</span> pushes the addresses back on.

There are two terms which need to be raised to the power of n, so let's make a helper that does that.

<span class=red>**n</span> <span class=white>n-n</span> <span class=green>1 n for over 1 */ next nip ;</span>

This word takes in the base that should be raised to the power of n. It starts with (our) <span class=green>1</span>, then <span class=green>n</span> times, it multiplies it by the base. Finally, it <span class=green>nip</span>s the base off the stack. Since the <span class=red>color</span><span class=green>Forth</span> :j&lt;for&gt; loop bricks when looping 0 times, this will fail when n = 0. Luckily, we sum starting at n = 1.

Now, let's look at the parts of the sum. First, we multiply by (x - a)^n. We might be tempted to calculate (x - a)/a, or x-a - 1, then raise *that* to the n, but I fear we would lose precision. Because of our setup, x - a will be below the top, so we can <span class=green>over **n</span> for this part.

Next, we divide by a^n. With (x - a)^n now the top of the stack, now a is second from the top. a <span class=green>over **n *1/</span> will raise it to the power and divide.

Now, we need to divide by n, a simple <span class=green>i /</span>. Here, since our divisor is a whole number and not fixed point, we can use normal division.

Finally, we need to fix the sign. This term should be added if n is odd, and subtracted if n is even.

<span class=red>sign</span> <span class=white>n-n</span> <span class=green>n 1 ? drop if ; then negate ;</span>

<span class=green>1 ?</span> tests n to see if the lowest bit is set. If it is, n is odd, and we just return. Otherwise, n is even, and we negate the number.

At the end of each loop iteration, we need to add this to the accumulator, which is now under our term, a, and x - a.

<span class=red>acc</span> <span class=white>cnn-cnn</span> <span class=green>push rot pop + -rot ;</span>

We will use <span class=green>16 for</span> ... <span class=green>next</span> to loop from 16 to 1.

After the loop, all that's next is to discard x - a and a. Putting it all together gives

<span class=red>tayl</span> <span class=white>xa-n</span> <span class=green>0,x-a,a 16 for</span><span class=blue>,</span>
<span class=blue>..</span><span class=green>over **n over **n *1/ i / sign acc next</span><span class=blue>,</span>
<span class=blue>..</span><span class=green>2drop ;</span>

Our final Taylor series will be used on the interval [1, 2]; so I think picking a = 3/2 makes sense.

To compute the Taylor series of ln(x) around a = 3/2, we first need to compute ln(3/2). We can use the the Taylor series of ln(x) around a = 1 for this. We know that ln(1) = 0, so we won't need to add anything to our result from <span class=green>tayl</span>. This means that ln(3/2) is simply <span class=green>1 3/2 tayl</span>.

Since this value is used a lot, I'll compute it at compile time and embed it into the word. In <span class=red>color</span><span class=green>Forth</span>, at compile time, a transition from yellow to green takes the top stack element and compiles it as a literal. In other words, it saves the top compile time stack element, and pushes it onto the stack at run time.

Now, we can finally estimate ln(x) around a = 3/2! I'll call this function <span class=green>ln'</span>.

<span class=red>3/2</span> <span class=green>3 *1 2 / ;</span>
<span class=red>ln'</span> <span class=white>n-n</span> <span class=green>3/2 swap tayl</span> <span class=yellow>1 3/2 tayl</span> <span class=green>+ ;</span>


It's all coming together
------------------------
If you remember from above, for a number x in the form 2^k * m, ln(x) = k ln(2) + ln(m). We have all the parts, so now we just need to put them together.

We can obtain k from finding the most significant bit. Then, m is x/2^k. Since finding the highest set bit and raising 2 to the n are clunky and inefficient in <span class=red>color</span><span class=green>Forth</span>, we'll implement them in <a href='internals/machinecode.html'>machine code</a>.

To find the highest set bit, we can use <a href='https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/bsr'>bsr</a>, which has opcode <i class=hgreen>0f bd</i>. We want to find the most significant bit of the top of the stack, which is in eax. This result should go back onto the top of the stack, so our modr/m byte will be 11 (both operands are registers) 000 (eax) 000 (eax), or <i class=hgreen>c0</i>.

<span class=yellow>macro</span><span class=blue>*</span><span class=red>bsr</span> <span class=white>n-n</span> <i class=hgreen>c0bd0f</i> <span class=green>3, ;</span> <span class=yellow>forth</span>

This word calculates floor(log2(x)) for an integer, but our number is in fixed point, so we need to divide by <span class=green>1</span> first. I will call it <span class=green>log2'</span>, since <span class=green>floorlog2</span> is quite long.

<span class=red>log2'</span> <span class=white>n-n</span> <span class=green>1 / bsr ;</span>

To compute 2^n, we can start with 0, then use <a href='https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/bts'>bts</a> to set the desired bit. Since we'll be zeroing eax, we need to first save its value into another register. <i class=hgreen>8b</i> for mov, then 11 001 (ecx) 000 (eax) is <i class=hgreen>c8</i>.

Next, we need to zero eax, which we can do by xoring it with itself. <i class=hgreen>31</i> (xor) 11 000 000 = <i class=hgreen>c0</i>.

Finally, we use bts (<i class=hgreen>0f ab</i>). It takes the destination as the r/m operand and the bit to set as the r operand, so our modr/m byte will be 11 001 000 = <i class=hgreen>c8</i>.

<span class=yellow>macro</span><span class=blue>*</span><span class=red>2**</span> <span class=white>n-n</span> <i class=hgreen>c031c88b</i> <span class=green>,</span> <i class=hgreen>c8ab0f</i> <span class=green>3, ;</span> <span class=yellow>forth</span>

We calculate the decimal part of ln(x) with ln(m). m = x/2^k, so this word will need to take both x and k from the stack.

<span class=red>decimal</span> <span class=white>nn-n</span> <span class=green>2** *1 *1/ ln' ;</span>

The whole part is k ln 2, so this only needs k from the stack.

<span class=red>whole</span> <span class=white>n-n</span> <span class=yellow>2 *1 ln'</span> <span class=green>+ ;</span>

Now, we just need to calculate k, call <span class=green>decimal</span> and <span class=green>whole</span>, and add them together.

<span class=red>ln</span> <span class=white>n-n</span> <span class=green>dup ln2' push i decimal pop whole + ;</span>

k is needed by both functions. For clarity, I <span class=green>push</span> it to the return stack. The first time we need k, I use <span class=green>i</span>; for the second and final time, I <span class=green>pop</span> it.

Time to try it out! Let's try ln(12345/42): <span class=yellow>12345 1 42 */ ln</span>

<span class=red>color</span><span class=green>Forth</span> responds with <span class=yellow>2979694</span>.

ln(12345/42) = ~5.6833369
2979694/2^19 = ~5.6833153

Not bad! 2^19 * ln(12345/42) rounds to 279705, so we're only off by 9 * 2^-19.


Our code isn't divine enough!
----------------------------
If you remember the original equation, we need ln(φ). A trick I learned from K is that φ can be approximated by repeated iteration of f(x) = 1 + 1/x. If you're curious why this works, 3b1b has a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfW845LNObM'>great video</a>.

<span class=red>phi</span> <span class=white>-n</span> <span class=green>1 16 for 1 swap *1/ 1 + next ;</span>


The results
-----------
Our final calculation is

<span class=red>pe25</span> <span class=green>5 *1 ln 2 / 10 *1 ln 999 * + phi<span class=blue>,</span>
<span class=blue>..</span>ln / 1 + ;</span>

which gives the right answer!

If we remove the division and rounding, we get that our final fraction is 1206428689/252292, which is ~0.015 off from the correct answer.

The multiplication by 999 really compounds the error from the ln(10). Our estimation for ln(10^999) is 1206006786, while the true answer is ~1206010516: a difference of ~3730 * 2^19.

Also, since the numerator is so much higher than the denominator, even adding 1 to the ln(phi) approximation (= changing it by 2^-19) changes the final answer by ~0.015.

Of course, this code could be made more accurate by precomputing <span class=green>ln3/2</span> and <span class=green>ln2</span>, then using those values; but I wanted to do everything from scratch. After all, if you're precomputing any values at all, why not just skip straight to precomputing the final answer?
