Justin and Nick discuss surviv.io
=================================

We all know the feeling—the adrenaline pumping through your veins, the feeling that you can’t tear your eyes away from the screen, the soaring feeling of victory when you win, and the sinking in your gut when you lose. Surviv.io is a rising game that makes players experience every one of those feelings listed above. In fact, these feelings are true to many popular games across the nation. But one thing we fail to ask is: what makes Surviv.io so popular? Is it the competitiveness that this .io game provides? Is it the feeling of encroaching doom provided by the ever-growing red zone? Today we are going to explore what the surviv community thinks about why people are so drawn to play surviv.io 

One reason why .io games are so massively popular is that they are easy to access and play. Surviv.io developer Nick explained that “.Io games are great because they run in a web browser and there's no wait time: you hit the play button and you're immediately in a multiplayer game with dozens or hundreds of other players! Additionally the best .io games are easy to pick up but require some skill to win and are addicting and replayable. My favorite .io games also have very simple visual styles which lets you focus on the gameplay.” This is quite true, as long wait times can be discouraging to many players, especially those who are playing in- between completing tasks. 

Games like Surviv.io are also very popular because “It's easier to play [them]—no downloads or installs. And you can play from work or school very easily,” according to Justin, another developer of Surviv.io. Also, with many players choosing to play on personal devices, surviv.io’s web version does not use up any storage space. 
“In some ways the big PC battle royale games like PUBG and Fornite are the opposite of .io games: they require a huge download, long matchmaking queues, fancy graphics, complex controls, and have lots of downtime just running around the map,” remarked Nick. 

But what makes Surviv.io unique out of all other .io games? Many players, such as Nick Impersonator believe that “the main attention grabber is how short each round is—the maximum time is only around 7.5 minutes.” Not only are the rounds short, they are filled with action. “Our idea was to take some fun parts of battle royale gameplay and merge it with the best aspects of an .io game... and surviv.io is what we ended up with! Although that is a little simplified. That was our goal when we first launched surviv.io a year ago. Since then the game has changed and grown a ton based on community feedback. Even though we started off as a 2d "demake" inspired by PUBG, at this point surviv.io has evolved into a unique experience with its own lore and gameplay,” explained Nick. Surviv.io also has grown a ton due to the feedback from the community. Justin explained how “at the start, our goal was to just make something fun and interesting that maybe a few dozen people would play. These days, we try to focus on making content that we know our players enjoy. The game modes have been very popular lately, so we've been putting a lot of focus on that lately.”

In conclusion, Surviv.io has grown to be such an immensely popular .io game. It’s action-packed short rounds are great for people who are playing at school, and for those who do not want to sit in a lobby waiting for players to join. It’s relatively simple style and gameplay make it easy for new players to get the hang of it. It doesn’t require downloads as well, which is very convenient for users across all platforms. Events and game modes, such as the most recent revival of Desert Rain provide an alternate experience to normal gameplay. These qualities set Surviv.io apart from the other hundreds of .io games, as it is one that is continuing to grow and prosper.
