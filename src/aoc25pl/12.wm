```
tree(tree(Area,Presents)) --> number(X), "x", number(Y), ": ", sequence(number," ",Presents), { Area #= X*Y }.
input(Trees) :- phrase_from_file((seq(_),sequence(tree,"\n",Trees)),"i/12.in").
solvable(tree(Area,Presents)) :- sum(Presents,#=,NPresents), NPresents*9 #=< Area.
run :- input(Trees), countall((member(Tree,Trees),solvable(Tree)),N), format("~d",[N]).
```


I didn't initially like this problem, but in hindsight, it's pretty fun :D! Happy AoC, and here's to many more!
