Advent of Code 2025 in Prolog
=============================

It's [that time of year again](https://adventofcode.com/2025)!! This year, I'm learning [Prolog](https://www.scryer.pl/). I tried this a few years ago, and failed miserably; hopefully it will go better this year!

For all of these, I have

```
:- use_module(library(pio)).
:- use_module(library(dcgs)).
:- use_module(library(clpz)).
:- set_prolog_flag(double_quotes, chars).
```

in my .scryerrc file.
