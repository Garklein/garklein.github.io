zombs stories
=============

zombs.io is a .io game where players make a base, and try to survive against waves of zombies. Like all .io games, it was played by many 10, 11, and 12 year olds.

The game isn't necessarily player vs player, but multiple bases can exist in the same map, and players can technically deal damage to other bases.

A player named darkness 203 took advantage of this. He managed to obtained RCE over the game, and created a clan of raiders whose mission was to destroy other people's bases, powered by cheats.

This becamse so powerful that it went beyond a mere clan, and became an army.

New recruits started in F tier. Soldiers in tiers D-F were slaves of tier A-C players. Their masters would give them orders, and when they raided enough bases, they would rise to the next tier.

Raiders also got points for destroying bases. Those points could be used in a secret online marketplace to buy information or better scripts. Players who raided well could buy better tools, and quicky rose through the ranks.

Every tier knew more than the one below it. A tiers knew almost everybody in the army, while slaves only knew their master, and perhaps a friend or two they met in game.

Above the A tier was a powerful triumvirate. One was the serious hacker who had created the army. The other two were close friends of his. One controlled the spies, and the other commanded the army.

The spymaster lead a division of 10-80 spies. Their job was to analyze every player in the game, gathering information and creating profiles. The spymaster would take this would take the information from the spies and use it to capture more members for the army. This capturing was said to be done by hacking into the victim's computer. (More likely, it was done by manipulating 11 year old players into getting their email.)

There's stories of d203 hacking into the work computer of a player's parent and getting them fired from work. Or perhaps he sent poison in the mail to an E tier soldier that wasn't behaving.

Were these stories true, or just made up to manipulate 12 year olds? We may never know.
